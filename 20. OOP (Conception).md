**Process-oriented**

1. A procedure is the code responsible for accomplishing a specific task.
2. Break down what you want to achieve into steps and complete them sequentially.

- The increase in the number of function parameters is not conducive to understanding the specific meaning.
- As program length and logic complexity increase, code clarity decreases.



**Object-oriented**

1. Simulate the real world and think about the nature of each object and what can be done. 
2. Decompose things onto objects, describe the role of each object, and then interact.
3. Properties correspond to the nature of the object, and methods correspond to what the object can do. (Methods are functions placed in a class, and properties are variables in the class)
4. (1) Create a class with multiple properties, and then create objects with class. ( Class is a template that creates an object, and an object is an instance of a class)

â€‹       (2)  Define a class with methods, and then use the class to create an object.

- Let the parameters be fewer, the object to which the property belongs is clarified.
- The program logic and the subsequent flow of data is clearer.



- Encapsulation

Hide the internal implementation details of the class, access and use it only through the external interface

- Inherit

1. Object-oriented programming allows the creation of hierarchical classes.
2. A class has a subclass and a parent class to represent a subordinate relationship. The properties and methods of the parent class are inherited without being defined repeatedly, reducing code redundancy.

- Polymorphism

Depending on the situation, methods can be defined separately in subclasses.
