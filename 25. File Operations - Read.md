**Read the file**

**Mode** : `r` = read-only		`w` = write-only		`a` = add		`r+` = read + add

*When no mode is selected, read-only is used by default.*

**Encoding (Optional)** : Example : utf-8

```python
open("path", "mode", encoding="encoding_method")
```

**Reads all the contents of the file and returns it as a string**

```python
f = open("path", "mode", encoding="encoding_method")
print(f.read())
```

*Notes: Suitable for plain text files such as `.txt`*

- After calling read( ), calling again returns an empty result because the program records the file read location, the first time has already read to the end, so the second read has no content.
- It is not recommended to use read( ) for large files, which will lead to insufficient memory.

**Read byte**

- The second call continues reading from the current location.

```python
f = open("path", "mode", encoding="encoding_method")
print(f.read(number_of_bytes))
```

**Readline**

- Only one line of content will be read, and the second time it will continue from the current place
- The end of the line is judged by the line break, which is used as part of what is read.

```python
f = open("path", "mode", encoding="encoding_method")
print(f.readline())
```

- When you don't know the number of lines, you can call the while function.

```python
f = open("path", "mode", encoding="encoding_method")
line = f.readline()
while line != "":
    print(line)
    line = f.readline()
```

**Readlines**

- Readlines reads the entire file contents and returns each line as a list element.
- Used in conjunction with a for loop

```python
f = open("path", "mode", encoding="encoding_method")
lines = f.readlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line)
```

**Close**

Finally, you need to close the file to free up system resources.

```python
f.close()
```

To prevent forgetting ï¼š

```python
with open("path") as f:
    operations
```
