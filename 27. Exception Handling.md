After an error is generated on a certain line of the program, all subsequent code will not be run.

**Exception type**

*IndexError*

Use an index outside the length range to value the list.

*ZeroDivisionError*

Divide the number by 0.

*FileNotFoundError*

The open file does not exist.

*TypeError*

Multiply two strings.

**Catch exceptions**

*Only the first eligible branch runs.*

```python
try:
  Code that you think might report an error.
except error_name:
  What to do after error_name occurs.
except error_name2:
  What to do after error_name2 occurs.
```

If you are not sure what error may have occurred :

```python
try:
  Code that you think might report an error.
except error_name:
  What to do after error_name occurs.
except error_name2:
  What to do after error_name2 occurs.
except:
  What to do after all other errors occur.
```

You can also use `else` and `finally` statements in the end.

*Example*

else :

```python
else:
  Run without any errors.
```

finally :

```python
finally:
  Execute whether the error occurs or not.
```
