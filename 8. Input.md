**Use `input("Prompt information")` to get information.**

*Example*

```python
input("How old are you ?")
```

**Save information**

```python
user_age = input("How old are you ?")
```

**To operate**

```python
print("Oh, you are " + user_age + " years old.")
```

- You can't use the input for calculations, because the input is string.
- But you can use Python function to make conversion.

**Convert to integers**

```python
int("123")
```

**Convert to float-point number**

```python
float("123")
```

**Convert to string**

```python
str(123.0)
```

*Integers and strings cannot be printed together, but integers canbe converted to strings.*

*Example*

```python
print("OK, you are " + str(15) + " years old.")
```

*Exercise (BMI Calculator)*

*BMI = Weight / (Height ** 2)*

```python
user_weight = float(input("Please enter your weight.(KG)"))
user_height = float(input("Please enter your height.(M)"))
user_BMI = user_weight / (user_height ** 2)
print("Your BMI value is " + str(user_BMI))
```
