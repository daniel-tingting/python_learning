- Objects are: lists, dictionaries, strings, etc.

**Iterate**

- List: Operate on individual elements sequentially.
- Dictionaries: Operate on each key value sequentially.
- Strings: Operate individual characters sequentially.

**Loop**

```python
for variable_name in iterables:
    To do with each variables
```

**Loop & Key-value pairs**

```python
directory.keys()		# All the keys
directory.values()	# All the values
directory.items()		# All the key-value pairs
```

**Range**

range(x,y)

- x: strating value
- y: end value

*Note: End value is not included*

*Example*

```python
for i in range(5, 10):
    print(i)
```

 range(x,y,z)

- z: Spans several numbers at a time.(z defaults to 1)

*Example*

```python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    total = total + i
print(total)
```
