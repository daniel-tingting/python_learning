**Locate the file**

**Absolute path**

- The path from the root directory

1. In Linux, macOS and other Unix-like systems, start with `/`, separate each directory with `/`, and end with the target file or target directory.
2. In Windows, start with the partition name plus a `\`, separate each directory with a `\`, and end with the target file or destination directory.

**Relative path**

- Start from a reference location.
- Indicates where other files are located from that file location.
- **UP**

1. Use `.` to indicate the directory where the reference file is currently located.
2. Use `..` indicate the parent directory one level higher
3. Use `../..` in Unix-like systems and `..\..` in Windows to indicate the parent directory of the parent directory to which the current directory belongs.

- **Down**

1. Use `/` in Unix-like system or `\` in WIndows to split directories in the path.

**Note : You can use the file name directly to access files in the same directory**
