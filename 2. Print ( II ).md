**Use `Print(" " + " " + " ")`to concatenate serveral strings sequentially.**

*Example*

```python
print("Hello" + " World" + " !")
```



**Use the same quote pairing or precede the string quotation marks with `\` when there are both single and double quotes.**

- `\` is called escape character.

*Example*

```python
print('Python said "Hello World !"')
print("Python said,\"Let\'s learn Python.\"")
```



**Make a line break with `\n`.**

*Example*

```python
print("I'm the first line.\nI'm the second line.")
```

**Use three concatenated single or double quotes to make a line break.**

```python
print("""I'm the first line.
I'm the second line.
I'm the third line.""")
```
