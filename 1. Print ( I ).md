**Use `print(" ")` to display the content in quotation marks.**

-  Use English punctuation.
- Text in quotation marks, the quotation marks before and after are the same.
- Variables do not need quotation marks.
- Search the content after Syntax Error ig the exit code is not 0.
- When the program logic is complex, `print(" ")` can be used to print out the current value to help understand the running situation.

*Example*

```python
print("Hello World !")
```
