**Write the file**

- When writing to a file, if the file does not exist, a file with an incoming file name is automatically created.
- `write( )` will not make a new line, you can use `\n` to make a new line.

**Note : When writing a file, if the original file already exists, the original file content will be erased**

```python
with open("path", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
  f.write("content")
```

**Add**

- If you don't want to empty the file contents, you can use mode add : `a`
- When writing to a file, if the file does not exist, a file with an incoming file name is automatically created.
- `write( )` will not make a new line, you can use `\n` to make a new line.

*Example*

```python
with open("path", "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
  f.write("content")
```



**Note: Files cannot be read in either `w` or `a` mode.**

**You can use mode `r+` to both read and add.**

*Example*

```python
with open("path", "r+", encoding="utf-8") as f:
  print(f.read())
  f.write("content")
```

*Exercise*

```python
with open("poem.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Nature's first green is gold, \n")
    f.write("Her hardest hue to hold. \n")
    f.write("Her early leaf's a flower; \n")
    f.write("But only so an hour. \n")
    f.write("Then leaf subsides to leaf. \n")
    f.write("So Eden sank to grief, \n")
with open("poem.txt", "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("So dawn goes down to day. \n")
    f.write("Nothing gold can stay.\n")
```
